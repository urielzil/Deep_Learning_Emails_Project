# The general idea is that given the email context, the model will decide whether an email is spam or not.

Some of the benefits that an email spam detector can provide:

Improved Email Productivity: By detecting and filtering spam emails, a spam detector helps to reduce the amount of time users spend sorting through their inboxes, allowing them to focus on important emails.

Increased Email Security: Spam emails often contain malicious links or attachments that can compromise a user's security. A spam detector helps to prevent these emails from reaching users' inboxes, improving overall email security.

Reduced Server Load: By filtering out a large volume of spam emails, a spam detector helps to reduce the load on email servers, improving their overall performance and reliability.

Better User Experience: A spam detector enhances the overall email experience for users by reducing the amount of unwanted and irrelevant emails they receive, making their email inboxes more organized and manageable.

Data Protection: Spam emails often contain phishing attempts or other forms of identity theft, which can compromise a user's personal and sensitive information. A spam detector helps to prevent these emails from reaching users, protecting their data.
